# postaviliprofesore.me
Built using:

* Django
* Django rest framework
* Bootstrap
* BS4 for web scraping

It scrapes the website of Univerziteti Crne Gore for new posts in different subject categories.
It then provides and interface to easily check out the latest posts to help students keep up to date with their course materials.
The UI could still use some work and the scraper is deprecated but I used this project as a learning opportunity and an introduction to postgres and django.
